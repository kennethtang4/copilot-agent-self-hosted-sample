# Self-Hosted GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

This repository contains example configuration files and scripts to set up a self-hosted GitHub Copilot Coding Agent using Kubernetes, Actions Runner Controller (ARC), and a custom runner image with pre-installed tools.

## 📋 Overview

The self-hosted GitHub Copilot Coding Agent allows you to run GitHub Copilot features on your own infrastructure, providing:

- **Control over compute resources**: Use your own hardware (including GPUs)
- **Custom environment**: Pre-configure tools, languages, and dependencies
- **Security**: Keep sensitive code within your infrastructure
- **Cost management**: Optimize resource usage for your specific needs

## 🏗️ Architecture

The setup consists of several components:

1. **Minikube Cluster**: Local Kubernetes cluster for testing and development
2. **Actions Runner Controller (ARC)**: Manages self-hosted GitHub Actions runners
3. **Custom Runner Image**: Docker container with:
   - GitHub Actions Runner base
   - CodeQL (v2.23.2) for security scanning
   - Node.js 22.x with YAML tools
   - Python 3 with AI/ML libraries (PyTorch, Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI)
   - VS Code CLI for debugging
   - Various development tools (git, jq, yamllint, etc.)

4. **Kubernetes Resources**: Helm charts for deploying and managing runners

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

### Required Software
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (v1.30+)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v20.10+)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (v3.0+)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (v1.25+)

### System Requirements
- **CPU**: Minimum 8 cores (32 cores recommended for GPU setup)
- **Memory**: Minimum 16GB (64GB recommended for GPU setup)
- **Disk**: Minimum 100GB free space (500GB recommended)
- **GPU** (optional): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 13.0 support for ML features

### GitHub Requirements
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following scopes:
  - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
  - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
  - `admin:org` (if using organization-level runners)
- Repository or organization where runners will be registered
- GitHub Copilot subscription (Business or Enterprise)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Variables to Set

Before installation, you **must** update the following configuration files:

#### 1. `copilot-agent-sample-runner/values.yaml`

Replace these placeholders:

```yaml
githubConfigUrl: "https://github.com/REPO_URL_WITHOUT_DOT_GIT"
# Replace with your repository or organization URL
# Examples:
#   - Repository: "https://github.com/myorg/myrepo"
#   - Organization: "https://github.com/myorg"

githubConfigSecret:
  github_token: "GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN"
# Replace with your GitHub Personal Access Token
# Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

#### 2. `copilot-setup-steps.yml`

This is an example workflow file. To use it:

1. Copy it to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Replace `REPO_NAME` in line 26 with your actual repository name
3. Update the `runs-on` label (line 14) if you change the runner installation name

```yaml
# Line 14: Update runner label if needed
runs-on: arc-runner-set-copilot-coding-agent

# Line 26-27: Replace REPO_NAME with your repository name
mkdir -p /home/runner/_work/REPO_NAME/.codeql-scratch
ln -s /opt/codeql /home/runner/_work/REPO_NAME/.codeql-scratch
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for detailed step-by-step installation instructions.

## 🔧 Maintenance Scripts

### `install.sh`
Main installation script that:
- Loads the Docker image into Minikube
- Installs ARC controller
- Deploys the runner scale set

### `reset.sh`
Quick reset that:
- Runs `nuke.sh` to clean up
- Runs `install.sh` to reinstall

### `nuke.sh`
Complete cleanup that:
- Stops and deletes Minikube cluster
- Restarts with fresh configuration
- Re-enables GPU support (if configured)

### `copilot-agent-sample-runner/upgrade.sh`
Updates an existing runner installation with new configuration changes.

## 📦 Docker Image Details

The custom runner image (`copilot-agent-sample-runner`) includes:

### Base Tools
- GitHub Actions Runner (latest)
- Node.js 22.x with npm
- Python 3 with pip
- Git, curl, wget, jq, tree, vim
- yamllint

### Security Tools
- CodeQL 2.23.2 (pre-installed at `/opt/codeql`)

### AI/ML Tools
- PyTorch with CUDA 13.0 support
- Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter, DeepSpeed, Pytest

### Development Tools
- VS Code CLI
- YAML parsing tools

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**: Never commit your GitHub Personal Access Token to the repository
2. **Network Security**: Consider network policies for production deployments
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU/memory limits in `values.yaml`
4. **Image Security**: Regularly update the base images and dependencies
5. **CodeQL**: The setup includes CodeQL for security scanning of your code

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Minikube won't start
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Check available resources
minikube config view

# Try deleting and recreating
minikube delete
minikube start --cpus=8 --memory=16g --disk-size=100g
```

### Runners not connecting to GitHub
1. Verify your GitHub token has correct permissions
2. Check the `githubConfigUrl` is correct (no `.git` suffix)
3. View runner logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n arc-runners -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runner-scale-set-listener
```

### Docker image not found
```bash
# Rebuild and load the image
cd copilot-agent-sample-runner
./build.sh
minikube image load copilot-agent-sample-runner:latest
```

### Helm installation fails
```bash
# Check Helm charts are accessible
helm repo update

# Verify namespace exists
kubectl get namespace arc-systems
kubectl get namespace arc-runners

# Check existing installations
helm list -A
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This setup is designed for **development and testing**. For production use, consider:
  - Using a real Kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS, AKS)
  - Implementing proper secrets management (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault)
  - Setting up monitoring and logging
  - Implementing backup and disaster recovery
  - Adding network security policies
  
- The GPU configuration in `nuke.sh` requires NVIDIA GPU support in your system and Docker
- Resource requirements are significant - ensure your system meets the minimum specifications
